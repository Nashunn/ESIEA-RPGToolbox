# ESIEA-RPGToolbox
> Mobile application to play boardgame 🎲

## Introduction

This application was made as part of our school work at ESIEA. 
The purpose was to create an application in the language of our choice with an **MVC** or **MVVM** pattern.
This application is coded in JAVA for Android smartphone and use an API called "DiceFul API".

RPGToolbox allows you to list players in order to count their points. It also has a part allowing you to simulate a 6-sided dice roll.
When you shake your phone to roll a dice, it will call the api, which will then return the result of the dice roll in JSON format.
